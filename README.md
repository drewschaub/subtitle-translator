# subtitle_translator
translate subtitles between english, japanese and chinese

This serves to automate subtitle translation for media server use. 

Subtitles containing chinese or japanese text may be encoded in many different formats which may cause issues when trying to translate. This program detects the underlying file encoding of each subtitle file in a folder and do bulk translation. 

Supported encodings include: 
```
EUC-CN
HZ
GBK
CP936
GB18030
EUC-TW
BIG5
CP950
BIG5-HKSCS
BIG5-HKSCS:2004
BIG5-HKSCS:2001
BIG5-HKSCS:1999
ISO-2022-CN
ISO-2022-CN-EXT
```

There are multiple data formats for subtitles. This initial version supports ```.srt```, though I have other file formats planned for the future.

This initial version currently only supports the paid version of DeepL, though I will add support for the non-paid version, as well as Google Translate. 

## Future Directions
1. Incorporate use of an autotranslater, such as PyTranscriber for automatic generation of text from audiofiles.
2. Include pre- and post-processing of subtitle files to handle nuances that arise with subtitle files, such as the use of ```â™«``` and other symbols which may confuse the translator models being useds by this automation tool.
